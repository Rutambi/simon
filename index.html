		<h2 class="headings"> About me</h2>

		<p>Simon Pierre Niwemugizi is my full name, but you can just call me Simon. I am currently living in Kigali, Rwanda. I have a passion for travel, fitness, food and love meeting new people. I am a die-hard fanatic football fan and cheer for Real Madrid.</p>

		<h3>My background is in computer hardware, including, software repairs and maintenance. Recently, I have also started to pursue a path in CODING.</h3> 

		<p>You heard it right…CODING! I have always had a desire to learn how to build and design websites and now have a new favorite hobby.</p>

		<p>To my surprise, coding is currently an in-demand skill and rewarding career path. I am currently building a portfolio of my work including this website. I intend to expand my knowledge and expertise in website development and become a full-stack web developer.</p>
		<p>I am a strong believer that nothing is impossible if you have a willing heart. My journey in web development has just begun, stay tuned for updates and new projects.</p>
